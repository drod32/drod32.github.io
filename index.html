    <p>Wikipedia Says</p>
    <blockquote>New Yorkâ€“style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in
        wide slices to go. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath
        its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella
        cheese. This style evolved in the U.S. from the pizza that originated in New York City in the early 1900s,
        itself derived from the Neapolitan-style pizza made in Italy. Today it is the dominant style eaten in the New
        York metropolitan area states of New York, and New Jersey and variously popular throughout the United States.
        Regional variations exist throughout the Northeast and elsewhere in the U.S.</blockquote>
